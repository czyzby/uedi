# UEDI Java 8

UEDI enhanced with Java 8 features. Thanks to the new `Parameter` class from reflection API, constructor and method parameter names can now be extracted and processed to resolve ambiguous dependencies. This makes it even more convenient to drop annotations. The application must be compiled with `-parameters` flag, though.
